## My Professional Statement (Draft)

*My name is Martin Gonçalves, and I'm a technology enthusiast based in Lisboa, Portugal. Before diving deep into tech, I completed an ATPL pilot course — an experience that shaped the way I think. Aviation taught me that details matter, that decisions have consequences, and that staying calm under pressure isn't optional. I carry that mindset into everything I do now.*

*I care a lot about keeping people safe online — their privacy, their money, their data. That's what draws me to cybersecurity. I've spent years tinkering with Linux, Docker, self-hosted servers, and building automation bots from scratch, so I'm not new to figuring out how systems work — or how they can go wrong. These days I'm channeling all of that into security, working through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and learning how attackers think so I can build better defenses.*

*I'm the kind of person who learns by doing. If something breaks, I want to know why. If there's a smarter way to do something, I'll find it. I want to work in an environment where that curiosity and drive actually make a difference.*

## Core Elements

### 1. Strengths
- **Technical problem-solving** — Years of hands-on work with Linux (Debian), Docker, Node.js, Raspberry Pi, Cloudflare, and Traefik means I can navigate complex systems and spot where things can go wrong
- **Automation and scripting** — Built bots and automation tools for real-world use cases like market prediction and crypto platforms, skills that translate directly into security monitoring and threat detection
- **Discipline under pressure** — ATPL training doesn't leave room for sloppy thinking; checklists, risk awareness, and clear-headed decision-making are habits I've carried into my technical work

### 2. Values
- **Protecting people's digital lives** — Everyone deserves to feel safe online, whether that's protecting someone's savings, their personal data, or a company's infrastructure
- **Doing the right thing** — Security work comes with a lot of responsibility and access; I believe in operating with honesty and integrity, always

### 3. Key Interests
- **What most interests you about cybersecurity?** I love the puzzle aspect of it — understanding how attacks happen and then figuring out how to stop them. I'm especially drawn to network security, threat analysis, and building automated tools that catch problems before they escalate.
- **How do your strengths and values support security goals?** My hands-on background with infrastructure and scripting means I can hit the ground running in technical environments. And coming from aviation, I already know what it means to treat every potential failure seriously. That combination — technical depth plus a safety-first mentality — is exactly what good security work demands.
